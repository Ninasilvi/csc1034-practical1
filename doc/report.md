__Tool 1: IDE__

I have used an IDE before, however, I only used Visual Studio, and have never heard of PyCharm before. This project has 
allowed me to explore another IDE option and learn how to use an unfamiliar environment, which will help me learn to 
navigate in new IDEs and work with them. That way, in future development practice, I can be more flexible in terms of 
the programming environments that I am able to use.

__Tool 2: Markdown__

I was already aware of README.md and what it was, but the concept of markdown itself was new to me. I really liked 
using markdown in this project, as well as the idea of writing text in an IDE, especially with the stylistic flexibility 
that markdown provides. I will definitely use it in the future when working on other development projects.

__Tool 3: Version Control__

I have used GitHub for version control in the past, however, my knowledge about git itself was very limited. During this 
project I learned more about version control and how to use different git GUI clients, such as GitLab. There are things 
about git and version control that I am still confused about, but I can use my current knowledge as a base for future 
research and integrate git and version control more frequently in future development practice.

__Tool 4: Dependency Management and Sandboxing__

This tool is the one I have never used or heard of before (although I have installed dependencies for projects before). 
Learning about it has helped me realise how important it is to manage dependencies used in projects, and learn how to 
create and use a sandbox. With that, I can create a sandbox whenever I need to use dependencies specific to a project to 
have them organized and linked to the project without having problems with versions within the global environment. I will 
definitely use dependency management and sandboxing in future development and I am happy that I have learned about it.

__Tool 5: RTM (Reading The Manual)__

I have used manuals and tutorials before, and I am planning to use them in the future. Learning about them was not 
something new to me, but it did emphasize the importance. This tool will not change my development practice much, 
as I already knew how to use manuals, but I will continue using them in the future whenever I am unsure about something 
or don't know how a program/language/dependency works.
